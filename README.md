## Pharma3:

We propose a forward-thinking prescription pipeline for the NHS with blockchain. Prescriptions are built on a need-to-know basis with ZK-Proofs, and authenticated as a three-way handshake between patient, doctor and pharmacy. Participants and drug stock remain accountable throughout the entire flow from supplier to patient.
